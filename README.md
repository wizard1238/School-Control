Have to have Node, Mongo, Zoom and OBS installed before using. Make sure OBS has [this plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-websocket-remote-control-obs-studio-from-websockets.466/) installed.
Under controllers/recordClass.js, go to fs.watch and change the file paths to suit your own system.

CD into folder, run ```npm install``` then ```npm run start```. Make sure OBS is running before doing this.
